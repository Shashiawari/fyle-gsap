# fyle-gsap
Fyle-GSAP is a dynamic and interactive web application that showcases smooth animations and transitions. It was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various powerful libraries:

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Used to create complex animations with ease, enhancing the user experience with smooth transitions and engaging visuals.

React: Provides a robust framework for building the user interface, ensuring that the application is responsive and maintainable.

Locomotive Scroll: Implemented for smooth scrolling effects, adding another layer of interactivity and engagement to the user experience.

This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and my ability to integrate various technologies to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
